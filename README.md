# Classic-Pairings
A MERN application based on the idea of wine pairing with movies, food and meetups in the Central Florida region.

# What's expected for the project:
•	Build should have utility.
•	Market or real-world research that proves our idea has REAL value to people.
•	Perform research on other web / mobile applications in our app's domain.
•	Report problems we're facing along the way.
•	Use Trello and GitHub.
•	Dig deep into documentation and external resources to find the tools we need.

# Required of each group, each project:
•	ReactJS.
•	A Node and Express Web Server.
•	Backed by MongoDB Database with Mongoose ORM.
•	Both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
•	Deployed using Heroku (with Data).
•	Utilize at least two libraries, packages, or technologies:
    - GraphQL
    - Facebook Incubator
•	Authentication of users.
•	Polished frontend / UI.
•	MVC Paradigm.
•	Good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

# Concept
Debora and Kathleen have invented the idea of wine pairing with movies, food and meetups in the Central Florida region. A friend needed advice on a party, we would direct him or her toward a bottle of red and a bottle of white with food and a movie that we designated as the "perfect pairing". Soon friends began to request that these selections be created in an application for easy reference.

# Key Points on how to pair wine, food and movies
1) Match weight and texture: So, a light dish needs a light wine, and a rich dish a rich wine. The same is true with pairing movie genres.

2) Match the intensity of flavor between the wine and food and the genre. One will have to take the lead, but the other should follow closely. 

3) Either contrast the flavors of the food and wine, as with famous sweet and salty pairings, or allow the flavors to complement each other as fruity, acidic Sangiovese does with tomatoes. This can work with textures as well, as when a sharp, acidic white helps to cut through the richness of a cream sauce.
